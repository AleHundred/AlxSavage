### Hola! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alejandra, but people (often) call me Alex.

My pronouns are She/Her/Hers.

Apart from planning and building interfaces of products that enable people to make technology serve humanity better, I also care about humans in tech.

Things that I care and think a lot about:

* Remote collaboration
* Inclusive environments
* Intersectionality in tech
* Knowledge sharing
* Learning theory
