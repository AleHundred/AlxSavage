### Hola! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alejandra, but people (often) call me Alex.

My pronouns are She/Her/Hers.

I currently work at Webflow as a Senior Software Engineer, but I have been playing with building stuff on the interwebs since the times of Geocities.

Apart from building interfaces of products that enable people to make technology serve humanity better, I also care about humans in tech, so I think a lot about remote collaboration, knowledge sharing and learning theory.
